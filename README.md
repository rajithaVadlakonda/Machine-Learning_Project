Project Description: Linear regression and gradient descent: A Predictive Approach for Housing Prices

Objective: The main objective of this project is to create a prediction model that estimates property values based on several features like age, area, number of bedrooms, etc. by utilizing gradient descent and linear regression.

Methodology:

Data preprocessing: collected dataset containing features of houses and their corresponding prices. Cleaned data by handling missing values, outliers, and categorical data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to understand the relationship between age, area, and number of bed rooms in a property and the house price (target variable).

Linear Regression Model: Applied the linear regression algorithm and calculated the cost function (mean squared error) and defined the hypothesis function.

Gradient Descent Optimization Applied the gradient descent algorithm to minimise the cost function. Selected appropriate learning rates and discussed their impact on convergence. Plot the cost function over iterations to visualise convergence. Evaluated the model's performance on the testing set by using parameters such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared (0.96).

Results and Interpretation: Analysed the influence of the regression intercept and coefficients on housing prices.

Tools and Technologies: Python and Libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn) and Jupyter Notebook
