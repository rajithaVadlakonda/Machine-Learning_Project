Project Description: Linear regression and gradient descent: A Predictive Approach for Housing Prices

Objective: The main objective of this project is to create a prediction model that estimates property values based on several features like age, area, number of bedrooms, etc. by utilizing gradient descent and linear regression.

Methodology:

Data preprocessing: collection of a dataset containing features of houses and their corresponding prices. Cleaning of the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and categorical data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct EDA to understand the relationship between age, area, and number of bed rooms in a property and the house price (target variable).

Linear Regression Model: Apply the linear regression algorithm to calculate the cost function (mean squared error) and define the hypothesis function.

Gradient Descent Optimization Applied the gradient descent algorithm to minimise the cost function. Select appropriate learning rates and discuss their impact on convergence. Plot the cost function over iterations to visualise convergence. Evaluated the model's performance on the testing set by using parameters such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared.

Results and Interpretation: Analysed the influence of the regression intercept and coefficients on housing prices.

Tools and Technologies: Python and Libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn) and Jupyter Notebook
